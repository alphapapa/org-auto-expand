This package automatically expands certain headings in an Org file depending on properties set, making it easy to always get the same initial view when finding a file.

** Quelpa

Installing with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]] is easy:

1.  Install [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package#installation][quelpa-use-package]] (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
2.  Add this form to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package org-auto-expand
    :quelpa (org-auto-expand :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/org-auto-expand"))
#+END_SRC

** Manual

  Install these required packages:

  + ~dash~

  Then put =org-auto-expand.el= in your ~load-path~, and put this in your init file:

  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'org-auto-expand)
  #+END_SRC

* Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

1.  Define auto-expansion settings in an Org file (see below).
2.  Run ~org-auto-expand~ to set visibility accordingly.  You may do this automatically in a file with a file- or dir-local variable.  See examples.

+  To start with all entries folded, set the variable ~org-startup-folded~ as desired, or use the ~#+STARTUP~ keyword.  
+  To reset to startup visibility before expanding entries, call ~org-auto-expand~ with a prefix argument.  This is especially useful when expanding on-demand rather than at file-visit time.

** Auto-expansion Settings

Auto-expansion settings may be set in two ways: with Org properties on headings, and with the file- or dir-local variable ~org-auto-expand-nodes~.

*** Properties

Set the =auto-expand= property on a node to a list of one or more of these values:

-  =heading=: Show just the heading.
-  =body=: Show the heading and its body, but not its children.
-  =children=: Show the heading's children, but not its body.
-  A number =N=: Show child headings =N= levels deep.
-  A symbol that =org-show-context= accepts as an argument.

For example, in this Org file:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,* Daily tasks
  :PROPERTIES:
  :auto-expand: body 1
  :END:

  Things to do every day.

  ,** Check email
  ,** Walk dog

  ,* Weekly tasks

  Things to do every week.

  ,** Check tire pressure
  ,** Attempt to walk cat
#+END_SRC

After running ~org-auto-expand~, you would see:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ,* Daily tasks
  :PROPERTIES:...

  Things to do every day.

  ,** Check email
  ,** Walk dog

  ,* Weekly tasks...
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Variable =org-auto-expand-nodes=

The variable =org-auto-expand-nodes= may be set as file-local or dir-local (e.g. using command ~add-file-local-variable~).  It should be an alist, the key of which should be an Org outline path (a list of heading strings corresponding to a node's hierarchy), and the value of which should be one of the values accepted by the =auto-expand= property.  The corresponding example, which also calls ~org-auto-expand~ automatically:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  # Local Variables:
  # org-auto-expand-nodes: ((("Daily tasks") body 1))
  # eval: (org-auto-expand)
  # End:
#+END_SRC
